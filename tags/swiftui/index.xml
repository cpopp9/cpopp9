      <description>This is undoubtably quite a lot of code that can be reduced, but I was happy with my first draft of this circular progress animation that I created in SwiftUI.
TimelineView() appears to be extremely efficient in creating animations that rely on a timer, without any of the inefficiencies of leaving a timer running constantly.
struct CircularProgress: View { var lineWidth: CGFloat = 40 @State var secondsCounter: Double = 0 @State var iconSizer: Bool = false var body: some View { TimelineView(.</description>

      <description>TabView in SwiftUI makes creating scrolling galleries a breeze when combined with the optional .tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle()) modifier.
In this example I overwrote the default appearance of the page indicators by running a simple function when the view appears so that the indicator dots are visible on a white background.
import SwiftUI struct ImageSlider: View { private let images = [&amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Oppenheimer&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Blue Beetle&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Haunted Mansion&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Mission Impossible&amp;#34;] var body: some View { TabView { ForEach(images, id: \.</description>

      <description>Custom view modifiers are extremely easy to create in SwiftUI, and allow you to:
reuse styles simplify your code maintain consistency update them quickly everywhere in your project import SwiftUI struct ButtonIcon: ViewModifier { func body(content: Content) -&amp;gt; some View { content .foregroundStyle(.white) .padding(EdgeInsets(top: 10, leading: 25, bottom: 10, trailing: 25)) .background(.green) .clipShape(Capsule()) } } struct CustomViewModifiers: View { var body: some View { Button() { // take picture } label: { Image(systemName: &amp;#34;camera.</description>

      <title>Using FocusState within SwiftUI</title>

      <description>@FocusState is a property wrapper within SwiftUI that allows us to track where the user is focused within our app.
In this example, we can suggest to the user to start on the first text field by preselecting focus for them, and provide visual feedback when they switch between fields.
import SwiftUI struct FocusStateTest: View { private enum FocusedField { case firstName, schoolAttended } @State private var firstName = &amp;#34;&amp;#34; @State private var schoolAttended = &amp;#34;&amp;#34; @FocusState private var focusedField: FocusedField?</description>

      <description>I came across a simple yet beautiful animation in the New York Times app the other day denoting their live updates feed.
It has three dots, all with different shades of red, alternating to imply to the user that changes to the story are happening rapidly in real time.
I always love challenging myself to get better at animations within SwiftUI, so I set out to recreate this cool little design.</description>

      <description>SwiftUI includes a native solution for a swipe to delete function from within lists, which works exactly as you would expect with just a few lines of additional code.
The code itself is simple, and involves us creating a ForEach of our array within our list, and adding a .onDelete modifier to trigger the removeItems function that we have created below our view body.

      <title>Adding Transparency to Sheets in SwiftUI</title>

      <guid>//coryjpopp.com/posts/adding-transparency-to-sheets-in-swiftui/</guid>
      <description>Native sheets in iOS are by default opaque, and require a bit of extra code to enable any form of transparency.
First we can create a new background view that conforms to UIViewRepresentable.
struct BackgroundClearView: UIViewRepresentable { func makeUIView(context: Context) -&amp;gt; UIView { let view = UIView() DispatchQueue.main.async { view.superview?.superview?.backgroundColor = .clear } return view } func updateUIView(_ uiView: UIView, context: Context) {} } And then we can use that transparent view as a background view within our sheet to enable transparency.</description>
